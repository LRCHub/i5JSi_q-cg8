Tell your friends that
I love the drama
Play pretend,
but you know it's karma
You're the one that's
lonely callin'
You can blame me,
but I ain't the problem
(Ooh)
You,
you keep on pushing my buttons,
you do
With me, you leveled up, yeah,
it's true
Now I'm somebody you don't
wanna lose
(Ooh-ooh)
You're just a Gameboy
I ain't tryna play, boy
I ain't thinkin' about you
Not thinkin' about you
Lovin' you's a game, boy
I should throw it away, boy
I ain't thinking about you, ooh
You're just a Gameboy
I ain't tryna play, boy
I ain't thinkin' about you
Not thinkin' about you
Lovin' you's a game, boy
I should throw it away, boy
I ain't thinking about you, ooh,
ooh
I been goin' out on my own time
I been doin' me but I don't mind
That's mine, that's mine
Me and all my friends in
the backseat
Headed to the club in the taxi
I'm fine, oh, no
(Ooh)
You,
you keep on pushing my buttons,
you do
With me, you leveled up, yeah,

Now I'm somebody you don't
wanna lose
